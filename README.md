# Currently work in progress!!!

# Graphlib
Fork from [cpettitt/graphlib] (https://github.com/cpettitt/graphlib), with some modifications: 
    - ES6
    - decreased bundle size as a result of webpack tree shaking on lodash
    - immutable option to support performant update checks in libraries like React 

Graphlib is a JavaScript library that provides data structures for undirected
and directed multi-graphs along with algorithms that can be used with them.

To learn more [see our Wiki](https://github.com/cpettitt/graphlib/wiki). 
To make graph immutable, specify it in options `new Graph({immutable: true})`
